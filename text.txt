How ls works?
https://gist.github.com/amitsaha/8169242

We have to handle all the file types.

https://linuxconfig.org/identifying-file-types-in-linux

7 different file types of Linux OS:

"ls" command will show the file type as an encoded symbol
found as the first character of the file permission part

- : regular file
d : directory
c : character device file
b : block device file
s : local socket file
p : named pipe
l : symbolic link

Character and block device files allow users and programs
to communicate with hardware peripheral devices. For example:
crw------- 1 root root 10, 165 Jan  4 10:13 /dev/vmmon

Character and block device files ussualy are placed in /dev directory (dev means "device")

File permissions:
Every file belongs to someone, it was created by someone, by any user that has account on that computer

Files can be readen, written or executable an any kind of cmbinations of it

read - read the data inside of the file or display it
write - write inside, modify, save the modofocations or delete a file
execute - run the file as program

Directories have to be executable if you want to get into them and create files or do anything
with files within a directory.
A directory can be readable - it eans you can see it's there, but if it's not executable you cannot
get into it and manipulate with files inside.

opendir(): http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/opendir.3.html
readdir()
clodedir()

Easy steps to follow on this project:
1. Learn ho to open read and close a directory.
2. Display the content of dyrectory
3. Before dysplaing it we need to sort the contetn of it depending
on the flags (or the absence of flags)
4. For that we need to pars the flags first. Special case is -R flag.
5. Handling the errors.
6. Add some colors and other bonuses.
7. Check for leaks, bus errors or segfaults. 

Step 1:
    I created an array of strings which will hold the name of the files and directories
    (the comtent) of the current directory (we dont have any path yet.) which is empty
    fom the beggining.
    We dont know the size also.
Step 2:
    I am getting this data (the content of directory) by using a while loop and opendir()
    and readdir() functions and variable sd.
Step 3:
    In this while loop we fill our array of stings where every string is gonna be the data
    (names of files and directories) just readed by readdir() function.
    Here we also have an counter which will hold the total number of files and directories
    in current directory (easier to say the "content").
Step 4:
    I need to sort this array in alphabetical order. I created a function arrstring_sort()
    for that.

    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-sort-an-array-of-strings-using-selection-sort/1

Step 5:
    After the array is sorted, i am parsing the flags.
    Depending on the flag I wil print differnt content.
